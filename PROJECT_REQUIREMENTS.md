## 1. Project Context & Background

### 1.1 User Profile

**Name:** Shivi  
**Age:** 37 (born February 1989)  
**Location:** Singapore  
**Occupation:** Senior Implementation Manager at Wise Platform APAC  
**Fitness Level:** Currently low - can jog for 5 minutes at 6:30/km pace, zero push-ups, zero pull-ups  
**Running History:** Ran 10km in 58 minutes in 2024 (5:48/km pace), but hasn't run for the whole of 2025  
**Device:** Google Pixel 10 Pro  
**Training Environment:** Outdoor running only in Singapore (heat/humidity considerations)

### 1.2 Personal Context

- Married to Srishti (Managing Consultant at ERM)
- No children yet, planning for 1-2 kids in next 1-5 years
- Struggles with maintaining routines and discipline (self-identified weakness)
- Prefers early morning workouts to avoid Singapore heat
- Has access to:
  - 400m running track near home
  - Serangoon Park Connector for longer runs
  - Apple Watch for tracking

### 1.3 Core Motivation

**Primary Goals (User Stated):**
- **Goal A:** Prove ability to commit to something for 14 weeks (discipline building)
- **Goal B:** Get back to 2024 fitness level
- **Secondary Goal:** Run 5.6km in under 30 minutes (5:20/km pace)

**Why These Goals Matter:**
- Goals A & B are controllable - about consistency and commitment
- The sub-30 minute time is the measurable outcome, not the core motivation
- Real success = showing up 4 days/week for 14 weeks in Singapore's heat
- This is about building routine discipline more than running speed

### 1.4 Race Details

**Event:** JP Morgan Corporate Challenge  
**Date:** April 16, 2026 (Saturday)  
**Distance:** 5.6 kilometers  
**Target Time:** Sub-30 minutes (29:45 ideal)  
**Target Pace:** 5:20/km  
**Training Duration:** 14 weeks (January 13 - April 16, 2026)

### 1.5 Pace Context & Rationale

**Historical Performance:**
- 2024: 10km in 58 minutes = 5:48/km pace
- 2025: No running activity (full year off)
- Current: Can jog 5 minutes at 6:30/km

**Target Pace Logic:**
- 5:48/km for 10km → targeting 5:20/km for 5.6km
- Running 28 seconds/km faster for half the distance is realistic
- Standard race formula: 5km pace ≈ 10km pace minus 15-30 seconds/km
- Target is at upper end of range = properly calibrated

**Respectable Context:**
- JP Morgan Corporate Challenge average: 32-38 minutes (5:45-6:45/km)
- Sub-30 puts runner in top 25-30% of finishers
- Fast runners: 22-25 minutes (4:00-4:30/km)
- Winners: ~18-20 minutes (3:20-3:35/km)

**Important Note:** User was initially uncertain if 5:20 was "respectable enough" - coaching response emphasized that comparison to others is counterproductive; focus should be on personal improvement and commitment to the 14-week process.

- **Critical:** Complete rest day before race, early bed times all week

### 2.3 Pace Definitions

**Easy Pace:** 6:15-6:45/km
- Should be able to speak in short sentences
- Nose breathing possible
- Feels sustainable for hours
- Heart rate: ~65-75% max
- Purpose: Aerobic base building, recovery

**Tempo Pace:** 5:40-5:50/km
- "Comfortably hard"
- Can speak a few words but not sentences
- Sustainable for 20-30 minutes
- Heart rate: ~80-85% max
- Purpose: Lactate threshold training

**Interval/Speed Pace:** 5:10-5:30/km
- Hard effort, breathing labored
- Cannot speak
- Sustainable only in short bursts
- Heart rate: ~90-95% max
- Purpose: VO2 max improvement, speed development

**Race Pace:** 5:20/km
- Goal race effort
- Hard but sustainable for 30 minutes
- Mental familiarity critical
- Purpose: Race-specific conditioning

### 2.4 Training Locations

**400m Track (Near Home):**
- **Use For:** Interval sessions (Weeks 10-13), Wednesday speed workouts
- **Advantage:** Precise pace measurement, flat surface
- **When:** Wednesday workouts requiring specific distances (800m, 400m repeats)

**Serangoon Park Connector:**
- **Use For:** Easy runs (Mon/Fri), Long runs (Sunday)
- **Advantage:** Shaded sections, more interesting scenery
- **When:** All non-interval days
- **Note:** Better for Singapore heat/humidity management

### 2.5 Singapore Environmental Considerations

**Heat/Humidity Challenges:**
- Singapore climate: 28-32°C, 80-90% humidity year-round
- Heat builds quickly after 7am
- Dehydration risk high

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Timing:** All runs before 7am (early morning mandatory)
- **Hydration:** Evening before + water ready post-run
- **Route:** Use shaded park connectors when possible
- **Pacing:** Easy runs may be slower in heat - that's okay
- **Recovery:** Extra attention to hydration on rest days

### 2.6 Weekly Check-In System

**Sunday Night Reflection (Every Week):**
1. ✅ Did I complete 3+ runs this week? (YES/NO)
2. ✅ Did I go to bed on time before run days? (YES/NO)
3. ✅ What almost stopped me this week?
4. ✅ What worked well?

**Purpose:** Identify patterns, build self-awareness, accountability

**The 2-Day Rule (Critical):**
- Can skip 1 scheduled run (life happens)
- CANNOT skip 2 consecutive scheduled runs
- If you miss 2, you're choosing to quit the goal (harsh but necessary clarity)

**Don't Break the Chain:**
- Mark each completed run with X on calendar
- Visual motivation
- Goal: No 3 blank days in a row

---

## 3. Success Metrics & Philosophy

### 3.1 Three-Tier Success Framework

**Tier 1 Success (The Real Win) - MOST IMPORTANT:**
- ✅ Completed 45+ of 56 scheduled runs (80% completion rate)
- ✅ Ran 4x/week for at least 11 of 14 weeks
- ✅ Proved to yourself you can commit
- **Why This Matters:** This IS the goal - everything else follows

**Tier 2 Success (Fitness Goal):**
- ✅ Finished the 5.6km race without walking
- ✅ Beat equivalent 2024 pace (5:48 → anything faster for 5.6km)
- **Why This Matters:** Validates training worked

**Tier 3 Success (Bonus):**
- ✅ Sub-30 minutes (5:20/km pace)
- **Why This Matters:** Exceeding expectations

**Critical Understanding:** If Tier 1 is achieved, Tiers 2 and 3 happen automatically. The discipline creates the fitness creates the time.

### 3.2 Race Day Strategy

**Target Splits for Sub-30min:**
- **Km 1:** 5:25 (start controlled, don't go out too fast - adrenaline trap)
- **Km 2:** 5:20 (settle into rhythm)
- **Km 3:** 5:20 (hold steady, this is where mental game matters)
- **Km 4:** 5:15 (start pushing if feeling good)
- **Km 5:** 5:15 (maintain pressure)
- **Last 600m:** Give everything (empty the tank)
- **Total Target:** ~29:45 (15-second buffer under 30:00)

**Pre-Race Protocol:**
- Wake 2-3 hours before race
- Light breakfast (familiar food - banana, toast, coffee)
- Arrive 45 minutes early
- 10-minute easy warm-up jog
- 3-4 strides at race pace
- Hit the toilet
- Start watch, trust training

**Mental Approach:**
- First km will feel easy (it should - be patient)
- Km 2-3 is mental - trust the pace
- Km 4-5 is when training pays off
- Last 600m is pure will - dig deep

### 3.3 What Success Really Means

**Reframing "Respectable":**
- Only comparison points that matter:
  1. You in 2024 (58 min 10km)
  2. You right now (5 mins at 6:30/km)
  3. You on April 16 (hopefully sub-30)
- Chasing "respectable" is a trap - there's always someone faster
- Sub-30 finish = top 25-30% of participants = objectively impressive
- More importantly: Came back after year off + committed 14 weeks + stuck to routine

**The Real Achievement:**
- Not about the 29:45 finish time
- About proving you can do what you say you'll do
- About building discipline you've struggled with
- About showing up 56 times when it would be easier not to
- The time is just the scoreboard

  rating: "4",                          // String "1"-"5"
  timestamp: "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z"     // ISO timestamp
}
```

### 5.6 Core Functions

#### Initialization
```javascript
function init() {
  // Load dashboard data
  // Set today's date in form
  // Populate week selectors
  // Update race countdown
  // Set up periodic countdown update (hourly)
}
```

#### Week Calculation
```javascript
function getCurrentWeek() {
  const today = new Date();
  const startDate = new Date('2026-01-13');
  const diffDays = Math.ceil((today - startDate) / (1000*60*60*24));
  const week = Math.ceil(diffDays / 7);
  return Math.max(1, Math.min(14, week));
}
```

#### Pace Calculation
```javascript
function calculatePace(duration_mins, distance_km) {
  if (!duration || !distance) return null;
  return (duration * 60) / distance; // Returns seconds per km
}
```

#### Pace Formatting
```javascript
function formatPace(seconds) {
  const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const secs = Math.round(seconds % 60);
  return `${mins}:${secs.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
}
```

#### Streak Calculation
```javascript
function calculateStreak(runs) {
  // Sort runs by date descending
  // Start from today
  // Count consecutive days with runs
  // Allow 1-day gaps (2-day rule)
  // Return streak count
}
```

### 5.7 Training Plan Data Structure

**Embedded in JavaScript:**
```javascript
const TRAINING_PLAN = {
  1: [
    {day: 'Monday', workout: '15 min easy', targetPace: '6:30-7:00/km'},
    {day: 'Wednesday', workout: '12 min easy', targetPace: '6:30-7:00/km'},
    // ... etc
  ],
  // ... weeks 2-14
}
```

**Usage:**
- Display today's workout on dashboard
- Reference for history validation
- No user editing (read-only)

### 5.8 Offline Support

**Service Worker (`sw.js`):**
- Cache all app files on install
- Intercept fetch requests
- Serve from cache when offline
- Update cache on activate

**Cache Strategy:**
- Cache-first for app files
- Network-first would fail offline
- No external resources to cache

**LocalStorage:**
- Already offline-capable
- Persists across sessions
- No sync required
- User responsible for data (no cloud backup)

### 5.9 Installation Flow

## 8. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### 8.1 Data Validation

**Mobile App:**
- Required fields enforced (HTML5 validation)
- Number inputs reject non-numeric
- Date inputs provide picker
- Pace calculation handles division by zero (returns null)
- Empty states for no data scenarios

**User Errors:**
- Missing a run: Can log retroactively (date picker allows past dates)
- Wrong data entered: No edit functionality (keep simple) - re-log with correct data
- Lost data: No recovery if LocalStorage cleared - warning in docs

### 8.2 Week Transitions

**Automatic Week Detection:**
- App calculates current week based on date
- Week 1 = Jan 13-19
- Week 2 = Jan 20-26
- ...etc
- Week 14 = Apr 12-16

**Mid-Week Start:**
- User might start tracking in Week 2
- App still shows correct current week
- Historical weeks can be logged retroactively

### 8.3 Missed Runs

**Philosophy:**
- App doesn't judge - it tracks
- Logging missed runs is encouraged (honesty)
- Provides pattern recognition

**Workflow:**
- Select date
- Mark "No, missed it"
- Optional: Explain why
- Saves with completed=false
- Shows in history with red bar
- Still counts toward total logged days (transparency)

### 8.4 Time Zones

**Not Applicable:**
- User is in Singapore (fixed location)
- Race is in Singapore
- No travel planned during training
- All dates use device local time

### 8.5 Device Change

**No Cloud Sync:**
- Data trapped in browser LocalStorage
- No account system
- No export feature

**If User Gets New Phone:**
- Data lost
- Intentional design choice (simplicity)
- User can take screenshots as backup
- Excel tracker is separate backup

## 16. Coaching Philosophy Integration

### 16.1 Core Principles Embedded in Design

**1. Discipline Over Performance:**
- Success Tier 1 = consistency (45+ of 56 runs)
- Success Tier 3 = race time (bonus)
- Weekly reflections focus on habits, not speed
- Missed run logging = accountability without judgment

**2. Honesty & Self-Awareness:**
- "Why did you miss it?" field
- "What almost stopped me?" weekly question
- Feeling scale (Great/Good/Okay/Tough)
- Purpose: Pattern recognition, not guilt

**3. The 2-Day Rule:**
- Not enforced by app (user responsibility)
- Mentioned in documentation
- Weekly reflection prompts self-checking
- App provides data, user provides discipline

**4. Progress Visualization:**
- Streak counter (positive reinforcement)
- Week completion % (clear target: 75%+)
- Total runs (cumulative progress)
- All designed to show: "You're doing it"

**5. Reframing Success:**
- Dashboard badge: "On Track" not "Good/Bad"
- No comparison to other runners
- Focus on personal baselines
- Race time is scoreboard, not the game

### 16.2 Psychological Safeguards

**Avoiding Negative Spirals:**
- Logging missed runs ≠ failure prompt
- Weekly rating includes "Poor" without judgment
- No streak breaks (1-day gaps allowed)
- No punitive language

**Building Positive Momentum:**
- Green completed run bars (visual satisfaction)
- Increasing stat numbers (tangible progress)
- Reflections capture wins (what worked well)
- Race countdown builds anticipation

---

## 17. User Context Integration

### 17.1 Personal Customization

**Singapore-Specific:**
- Early morning emphasis (heat mitigation)
- Local training locations mentioned (Serangoon Park)
- Race name (JP Morgan) in all interfaces
- Climate considerations in coaching notes

**Relationship Context:**
- References to Srishti in reflection prompts ("support from Srishti")
- Bedtime discipline (shared routine with partner)
- No kids factor (time flexibility)

**Work Context:**
- 4 runs/week = realistic for working professional
- Weekend long runs (more time available)
- No midday runs (work hours)

### 17.2 Personality Alignment

**For Someone Who:**
- Struggles with routine → Simple, minimal interface (no overwhelm)
- Values honesty → Missed run logging encouraged
- Analytical mindset → Data/stats prominent
- Achievement-oriented → Multiple success tiers

## 20. Conclusion

This project is fundamentally about building discipline and consistency, with running as the vehicle and a race time as the scoreboard. Every design decision - from the simple UI to the weekly reflections to the three-tier success framework - supports the core goal: helping Shivi prove to himself that he can do what he says he'll do for 14 weeks.

The technical implementation is intentionally simple and offline-first to remove barriers to daily use. The training plan is progressive and realistic given the user's history. The success metrics are honest and aligned with intrinsic motivation rather than external validation.

This is not a general-purpose running app. This is a specific tool for a specific person with specific goals in a specific timeframe. That specificity is its strength.

**Next Action:** Build it, test it, deliver it, then get out of the way and let Shivi do the work.

---

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 11, 2026  
**For:** Claude Code Development  
**User:** Shivi  
**Race Date:** April 16, 2026  
**First Run:** January 13, 2026  

**Remember:** The app is not the achievement. The 56 runs are the achievement. The app just makes them visible.

🏃‍♂️ Good luck, Shivi. You've got this.
